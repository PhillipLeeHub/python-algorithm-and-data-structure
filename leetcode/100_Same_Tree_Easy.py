100. Same Tree Easy

Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

#         self.left = left

class Solution:
    def isSameTree(self, p: Optional[TreeNode], q: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        if p is None and q is None:
            return True
        
        if p is None or q is None:
            return False
        
        if p.val != q.val:
            return False
        
        return (self.isSameTree(p.left, q.left) & self.isSameTree(p.right, q.right))
